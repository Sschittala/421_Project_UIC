43,9,72,13,65,no\,65,65,79,1.0,1,1.0,,1.5129255,1,1.0781331
44,9,72,14,79,I think it was zimbabwae. Did your article have the actual cause,79,65,79,1.0,1,1.0,,1.7867151,1,1.2041577
45,9,72,15,65,"no they had a few suggestions, like lightning ",65,65,79,1.0,1,1.0,,1.9229294,1,1.7636225

47,9,72,17,65,the chances of that happening are really low,65,65,79,1.0,1,1.0,,1.686964,2,1.0366096
48,9,72,18,79,Yeah maybe a attack or something more likely ,79,65,79,2.0,1,1.0,,1.635869,1,1.3978901
49,9,72,19,65,yeah might have been intentional ,65,65,79,2.0,1,1.0,,1.404501,1,1.1432772
50,9,72,20,79,That makes it sort of less sad in a way to me ,79,65,79,2.0,1,1.0,,2.4468317,2,2.6181567
51,9,72,21,65,yeah kinda. what emotions did you get?,65,65,79,1.0,1,1.0,,2.326301,1,1.8158443

53,9,72,23,65,i felt some anger too,65,65,79,2.0,2,2.0,,2.9186268,2,3.250724
54,9,72,24,79,was it only men or any kids die?,79,65,79,1.0,1,1.0,,2.1850858,1,1.9529767
55,9,72,25,65,they did not specify ,65,65,79,1.0,1,1.0,,0.71068764,1,0.7592617

59,9,72,29,65,anything else left to talk about?,65,65,79,1.0,1,1.0,,1.3391889,1,1.2031232
60,9,72,30,79,i don't really think so we have a few rounds left tho so be quick,79,65,79,1.0,1,1.0,,1.0671222,1,1.3697016
61,9,74,1,61,hello. Did you read the article?,61,61,81,1.0,1,1.0,,0.96836513,1,0.7102239
62,9,74,2,81,"hello, yes I did read the article",81,61,81,1.0,1,1.0,,1.1426104,1,0.95758545
63,9,74,3,61,Such a tragedy. My first reaction was sadness. I felt so bad for them and their families.,61,61,81,3.0,2,4.0,,3.4172816,2,2.9029813
64,9,74,4,81,"It is indeed a tragedy. My first reaction was surprise, given the number of people that perished. I also feel for their families.",81,61,81,3.0,2,4.0,,3.0811625,2,2.8617716
65,9,74,5,61," Yes, surprise I felt that way too. I wonder what type of fire they said in the article that was burning near the tanker to cause it to explode and then they said another theory was a lightning strike. What do you think?",61,61,81,2.0,1,4.0,,2.3937669,2,1.8715088
66,9,74,6,81,Lightning strike would be incredibly unlucky and uncommon. The article didn't seem to lean towards either theory. What do you think might have been the cause?,81,61,81,2.0,1,3.0,,2.4381008,2,2.4440393
67,9,74,7,61," Yeah, I see a lightning strike unlikely. They would use that as a reason I don't think I would believe that honestly. And there's no details though enough for me to even judge that I guess. They didn't really give too many details.",61,61,81,2.0,1,3.0,,2.387095,2,2.5801954
68,9,74,8,81,"Yes, either way incredibly unfortunate. They stated that over a hundred people were injured in addition to the 73 that died and many tried to get to a nearby river. I'm sure the truth will come out with that many witnesses.",81,61,81,2.0,2,4.0,,2.3050976,2,2.349223
69,9,74,9,61,"yes whenever I read that part man, I cannot even imagine, trying to get into a river on fire that would just be god-awful ",61,61,81,3.0,2,4.0,,2.5652583,2,2.7681723
70,9,74,10,81,"Yes, it made me think of some war photos that I have seen with bodies in vehicles from people that also died to I believe a bombing. I wonder who will be held responsible.",81,61,81,3.0,2,4.0,,2.911602,2,2.8665907
71,9,74,11,61,"yeah, I know what you mean on that part. I wonder something this place it doesn't really say where it is besides the name Mozambique is that a region known for terrorist attacks?",61,61,81,2.0,1,3.0,,1.98139,1,1.72665
72,9,74,12,81,I'm not familiar with that region. I believe they said the tanker was from a nearby city. I'm guessing that it occurred on something like a highway or interstate given that the number of people that had to have been in the vicinity seemed quite large.,81,61,81,2.0,1,3.0,,1.893601,1,1.6866527
73,9,74,13,61,"I guess Google says that it is a country in east Africa the countries, 35th largest country",61,61,81,1.0,1,1.0,,1.0766691,1,1.4707165
74,9,74,14,81,"Yeah, I am not familiar with it at all besides knowing that it is in Africa. I do wonder if it could have been a terrorist attack. That would be a real shame.",81,61,81,2.0,2,4.0,,2.1140995,2,2.0733995
75,9,74,15,61,"I also fetched info off of Google for that just now it says:  Mozambique is still grappling with a military insurgency in parts of the gas-rich province of Cabo-Delgado; the four-year conflict has caused an estimated 4,000 deaths and displaced nearly one million people. How to see what year there's articles from that I'm looking at, but it isn't even on there",61,61,81,1.0,1,4.0,,2.3263772,1,1.7008821
76,9,74,16,81,I can't imagine living somewhere like that. I wonder what leads to something like that being allowed to happen. What is their government doing?,81,61,81,3.0,2,2.0,,2.314774,2,2.5150778
77,9,74,17,61,"Makes me thankful to be living in the USA every single day that's for sure!...(btw plz excuse my grammar mistakes and miss spellings and typos I'd like to blame it on my keyboard, but I just cannot do that.lol bcse it's totally me, but I know how to spell very clearly, but my hands are functioning today.)",61,61,81,3.0,0,3.0,,2.3558974,1,1.5563538
78,9,74,18,81,"No problem, I type faster than I should and often make mistakes. Yes, we have our own share of problems here but I am also thankful to be here. Makes me feel helpless sometimes hearing about these tragedies and not being able to do anything about it.",81,61,81,2.0,2,3.0,,2.4444385,1,1.3585433
79,9,74,19,61,"amen to that. You hit the nail on the head. We all have our own share of problems and i know there's somebody out there that always has it worse so whenever I get down on myself, I try to remember that it could always be worse.",61,61,81,3.0,0,4.0,,2.868483,2,2.7340972
80,9,74,20,81,"Yes, whenever something like this really makes you think and trivializes everyday problems. It makes me thankful for what I have. ",81,61,81,3.0,0,4.0,,2.6450436,0,2.7511392
81,9,74,21,61,"Exactly! I may not have much, but I consider myself rich, because I am thankful for every single thing that I have. That's the truth.",61,61,81,3.0,0,3.0,,2.5869398,0,2.1485128
82,9,74,22,81,That is an eloquent way of putting it. I do hope that someday people that suffer like that will have only mostly trivial problems to worry about like I do.,81,61,81,3.0,0,4.0,,2.8660722,2,2.7248423
83,9,74,23,61,Right on! totally agree with you! Guess that only thing I feel like I can do is just say a prayer for them. ,61,61,81,3.0,0,4.0,,2.605844,1,2.516531

85,9,74,25,61,"If you donate to the right charity, and do our research about it, like the Red Cross, they are well known, and very credible",61,61,81,2.0,1,3.0,,1.8845475,0,1.9604189
86,9,74,26,81,That is true. I am sure that there is an organization there like the Red Cross. I imagine that they are still there helping people to rebuild their lives afterwards. It is a really selfless pursuit that people that work in those organization undertake.,81,61,81,2.0,0,3.0,,2.4175062,2,2.5828774

88,9,74,28,81,I remember Red Cross always have a donation stand outside of stores but haven't seen one in probably over a decade. I guess the way to make donations now is directly or online. Thanks for the chat and sharing your perspective.,81,61,81,2.0,1,3.0,,1.8298095,2,2.6609495

96,10,80,6,89,I am glad I am not the only one who had a hard time understanding it.  I think we always have to make some sort of compromise bewteen humans and other beings. we can;t just let them dictate. but I think individuals and not governements need to do it themsleves,89,33,89,2.5,1,1.0,,2.0450103,1,1.8888884

98,10,80,8,89,"yes, deinfitely not written by a native English speaker.  what would else could you gather though. I always wonder why peopel who believe in evolution try so hard to preserve species when it kind of goes against the whole idea. Maybe they could involve into something better adapted",89,33,89,2.0,1,2.0,,1.5677769,1,1.6177075

110,10,80,20,89,I don;t like it but I don;t think we should do awya with people as a solution,89,33,89,3.0,1,3.0,,1.8703113,1,1.9468277
111,10,80,21,33,...moved and wiped out and all. I have neighbors with cougars in their back yard,33,33,89,3.0,2,2.0,,2.1219342,2,1.5297518
112,10,80,22,89,wow. if all species that eve lived were still here they would not asll fit,89,33,89,2.5,1,1.0,,1.7273244,1,2.01133
113,10,80,23,33,I suppose Indonesia must be landlocked or something? Can these apes escape or...?,33,33,89,2.0,1,2.0,,1.6292164,1,1.7783225
114,10,80,24,89,I think it is a bunch of islands actually,89,33,89,2.0,1,1.0,,1.0675375,1,1.1215703
115,10,80,25,33,Oh.. that's right...!,33,33,89,2.0,1,1.0,,2.166484,1,0.951828

119,10,80,29,33,they stated something like 700 to 1000 deaths out of a 1700 population - this is curiously precise math for such a sloppily translated article,33,33,89,3.0,1,2.0,,1.7979531,1,1.664252
120,10,80,30,89,haha. yeah.  I think a lot of it was specualtion,89,33,89,2.5,1,1.0,,2.3214827,1,1.6508453

123,12,85,3,75,I guess we can discuss the article now. Firs reaction is of sadness. ,75,75,74,3.0,2,4.0,,2.4910784,1,2.1874995
124,12,85,4,74,"yes, exactly that. I was thinking that magnitudes of these calamities is the same everywhere but poorer countries are just not equipped to handle them",74,75,74,2.0,2,3.0,,2.690786,2,2.1751473
125,12,85,5,75,"It sems that Haiti is a truly devastated country. Earthquakes, hurricanes. Worse off is the economic collapse they live thorugh. ",75,75,74,3.0,2,2.0,,3.2360487,2,3.094791
126,12,85,6,74,Some people really get the worst birth lottery,74,75,74,3.0,2,2.0,,3.0627542,2,2.024418

128,12,85,8,74,It is just so much harder when you are already poor and then you have to fight these natural disasters too. They really do need help,74,75,74,3.0,2,3.0,,2.827084,2,3.253878
129,12,85,9,75,Do you think Americans in general would support any help to Haiti? ,75,75,74,1.0,1,2.0,,1.7510668,1,1.6147187
130,12,85,10,74,I hope so. I know that people do care about those devastated by such disasters ,74,75,74,2.0,0,3.0,,2.514223,1,2.693801
131,12,85,11,75,For example an aid package? I am not sure how peope would react. Seeing how people were so negative about aid to ukarine,75,75,74,2.0,1,2.0,,1.6013407,2,2.2002246
132,12,85,12,74,Ukraine had a political angle to it where some people thought that it could have been avoided but you can't avoid a hurricane. Hopefully media provides more awareness to people about situation in Haiti,74,75,74,3.0,0,3.0,,2.3664908,2,2.037779

134,12,85,14,74,"Yeah, I remember those times, I think there is people doing it still but the scale is much smaller now. People seem to have stepped back and let the govts and aid agencies lead the relief efforts",74,75,74,2.0,1,2.0,,2.7527072,2,2.4856348
135,12,85,15,75,"And you are right, politics seem to be injected (no pun intended) into EVRYHTHING now. No real altruisim without ‘angles’ now. No help without an agenda. Truly sad. ",75,75,74,3.0,1,2.0,,2.4577317,2,1.77735
136,12,85,16,74,I do know that people struggling to put food on their table wouldn't care much about who is giving it and for what ulterior purpose.,74,75,74,3.0,1,2.0,,2.5577526,2,2.4702182
137,12,85,17,75,"Great point,    Also maybe a sense of fabricated victimhood, whenever help/aid to foreign countries is mentioned, too many people bring up issues here. For example ‘we have hunger here, ‘we struggle in america too’ and all those arguments. ",75,75,74,3.0,2,2.0,,2.3519924,1,2.2159119
138,12,85,18,74,Well there is some truth to that too and I have seen more money getting invested inside US which could have gone to Africa e.g. in the past but I still hope that there is enough left for those people who are really desperate and have absolutely no other means to survive except aid,74,75,74,3.0,2,2.0,,2.572948,2,2.907552

146,12,85,26,74,"Agreed. It's just that sometimes there is no choice, you have to sacrifice some self interest so that others around you can thrive. It is not fair probably but it is what it is",74,75,74,3.0,0,2.0,,2.369672,2,1.9333043

152,10,96,2,96,Hi!,96,95,96,1.0,1,1.0,,1.2089709,1,1.1758912
153,10,96,3,95,So the article was pretty sad.,95,95,96,3.0,2,3.0,,2.6864438,2,2.7794955
154,10,96,4,96,"Yeah, I agree, humans taking away the homes of endangered animals for work is super sad.",96,95,96,3.0,2,4.0,,3.2752984,2,3.314691
155,10,96,5,95,I really hope someone can step in because the government there has done a poor job protecting them.,95,95,96,3.0,2,3.0,,2.6053252,2,2.6103458
156,10,96,6,96,I hope so as well. I'm surprised their lands are not more heavily protected due to them being so endangered.,96,95,96,3.0,2,3.0,,2.3076763,1,2.819355
157,10,96,7,95,It's hard to protect them when the local government puts money ahead of protecting them. It's hard for an outside group to step in.,95,95,96,3.0,2,2.0,,2.4420786,2,2.6244545
158,10,96,8,96,"Hopefully if people cause an uproar about it it'll be stopped. But, unfortunately, probably not.",96,95,96,3.0,2,2.0,,2.2732735,2,2.163103
159,10,96,9,95,I think the only way is to give their government money not to destroy their habitat but then you would have to just permanently send them money because it wont go away.,95,95,96,3.0,2,2.0,,2.219769,1,2.7018785
160,10,96,10,96,"Yeah, or another company would have to buy it for more and have better plans for it. I'm surprised wildlife conservationists haven't bought essential lands like that. I know they own some where the rescues are.",96,95,96,3.0,1,3.0,,2.1339169,1,2.4373412
161,10,96,11,95,I bet they're looking into it since it sounds like a pretty big deal.,95,95,96,3.0,1,3.0,,2.1653447,2,1.7374418
162,10,96,12,96,I hate the fact so many people value money over the welfare of the overall planet and animals. It's so sad.,96,95,96,3.0,2,4.0,,3.2138083,2,2.931482
163,10,96,13,95,"Yeah, I don't buy food with palm oil in it anymore for this reason unless it's sustainably sourced. I know that won't stop the issue but at least I can not contribute.",95,95,96,3.0,2,3.0,,2.6139097,2,1.7068198
164,10,96,14,96,I have truly not even heard of palm oil being linked to this or I haven't paid enough attention but I definitely will now. It won't stop it but enough people choosing not to buy it does impact them atleast.,96,95,96,3.0,2,3.0,,2.6984756,2,2.0561955
165,10,96,15,95,I'm vegan so I think I just hear more about some of these things from the people I follow on social media. I just want to do whatever I can and hopefully others do the same and then that's how change happens.,95,95,96,2.0,1,3.0,,2.1840844,1,2.0346224
166,10,96,16,96,"Yeah, you're right. That way of thinking is what makes change happen, so that's great. I will definitely look more into it after this.",96,95,96,3.0,0,3.0,,2.329443,1,2.2213857
167,10,96,17,95,Awesome! I'm going to read up on this issue too and see if anyone is trying to help.,95,95,96,3.0,0,3.0,,2.1671596,1,1.4655123
168,10,96,18,96,"This kind of reminds me of the show Orangutan Island on Animal Planet a while back, if you've ever seen that. I don't remember the reason why their lands were getting destroyed specifically but it was a similar issue I believe.",96,95,96,2.0,2,3.0,,2.205668,2,2.3517804
169,10,96,19,95,"Interesting, I'll have to check that out.",95,95,96,2.0,1,2.0,,1.5161364,1,1.2250241
170,10,96,20,96,It was a cute show but I love animal shows. Just hopefully we stop ruining the natural habitat of so many animals because it's a widespread problem and not enough attention is called to it.,96,95,96,3.0,0,3.0,,2.2813945,1,1.9615426
171,10,96,21,95,"Yeah, you hate to see that kind of careless behavior. Especially when it's their own government allowing it happen.",95,95,96,3.0,2,3.0,,2.5085087,2,2.3924148
172,10,96,22,96,"Yep, I guess people do call attention to things, just the governments don't quite respond to the will of the people as much as they should. For example, the whole Willow Project ordeal that's happening.",96,95,96,2.0,2,3.0,,2.6130357,2,2.2154498
173,10,96,23,95,"Yeah, in general, money wins when it's either animals or the environment up against it.",95,95,96,2.0,2,2.0,,2.2229424,2,1.9042561
174,10,96,24,96,It sucks. I hope that changes in the future as climate change and animals start demanding it,96,95,96,3.0,2,3.0,,2.958539,2,2.4610672
175,10,96,25,95,I think it's slowly changing but it may be too late.,95,95,96,2.0,2,3.0,,2.0215554,1,1.9158275

183,10,98,3,97,My reactions to the article was that there is work to be done. You?,97,97,98,2.0,1,2.0,,2.177047,1,2.0962813
184,10,98,4,98,i feel serious intervention is needed,98,97,98,3.0,2,3.0,,1.9702182,1,2.549818
185,10,98,5,97,That was way too many fires that took place in 2015.,97,97,98,2.0,2,2.0,,2.2265196,2,2.4239054
186,10,98,6,98,unfortunately and now they are clearing the same forest,98,97,98,2.0,2,2.0,,2.192672,2,2.0159688
187,10,98,7,97,illegal logging is also a issue,97,97,98,2.0,2,2.0,,2.3361306,2,1.5382776

189,10,98,9,97,I totally agree because there are conflicting opinions.,97,97,98,2.0,1,1.0,,2.315837,1,1.8251877
190,10,98,10,98,"Kind of confusing. Maybe the community benefits more from the company. If so, then they should also priotize the orangutuns ",98,97,98,2.0,1,2.0,,2.3835292,1,2.5151384
191,10,98,11,97,Yes I was just about to mention that.  It is said to be the third largest population of critically Endangered orangutans in the province.  That's terrible and scary.,97,97,98,3.0,2,4.0,,2.767537,2,3.067554
192,10,98,12,98,I believe it is very important they look into the well being of the animals not just the economic side of the palm plantation since it underscores the all purpose of that forest,98,97,98,3.0,2,3.0,,2.2116356,1,1.9358978
193,10,98,13,97,"I agree the article also said something about if the conversion plans go ahead 500 to 1,000 of them will likely die or need to be rescued. Don't know if that's a good or bad thing.",97,97,98,3.0,2,1.0,,2.487244,2,2.207775
194,10,98,14,98,that's a bad thing because they estimate their population is 750-1750. ,98,97,98,2.0,2,2.0,,1.5296087,1,1.0789691
195,10,98,15,97,"Wow, that's crazy!",97,97,98,4.0,2,2.0,,2.6821384,1,1.5356171

200,10,98,20,98,sure. Their Government needs to be part of the solution and not the problem,98,97,98,3.0,1,2.0,,2.486657,1,1.8008196

217,13,99,7,39,"Yeah, I guess I agree with that too. I mean I hate killing of anything alive-including plants and insects. But I will say I feel like the article kind of made it seem like this was a person that was killed-and not a wild animal.",39,39,99,2.0,2,2.0,,2.353288,2,2.2494392
218,13,99,8,99,I think it clearly referred to the killing of a wolf not a person.  The wolf was collared by that Activist group so was off limits to any hunting. ,99,39,99,2.0,2,2.0,,1.5520306,1,1.4878081

226,13,99,16,99,I think they said something about that.  I don't know if they can catch the person who did this but it does bring awareness to these types of things.,99,39,99,2.0,1,3.0,,2.541956,2,2.3990352

363,14,108,3,69,I felt sad for the victim and family as well. I was confused as well. I figured that the gunman had something against Michael. I wish there some more details included.,69,69,60,3.0,2,3.0,,2.5788095,2,2.4977725
364,14,108,4,60,"Yes, I thought it was quite curious, perhaps even conspicuous, that there was basically no description of the murderer at all.  It makes me wonder what's being hidden.  At least they're dead.",60,69,60,3.0,2,2.0,,1.7724806,2,2.2516916
365,14,108,5,69,True. I also wonder how he was able to get a gun into the airport. Or perhaps it was in a public area? I think the article mentioned it was somewhat close to the employee parking.,69,69,60,3.0,1,2.0,,1.7979653,1,1.9733593
366,14,108,6,60,"Yes, I think it was in the parking area, although I also think there are ways around airport security, unfortunately.  I thought the sadest thing was learning of the victim's children.  Obviously most 52-year-olds have children, but to have it explicitly stated makes it strike home that those adult children just lost their dad.",60,69,60,4.0,2,3.0,,2.8830376,2,3.217484
367,14,108,7,69,"Yeah, I couldn't imagine losing my father suddenly like this. It is cool that his children are athletes as well though. I'm sure he was really proud of their success.",69,69,60,4.0,2,1.5,,2.8798907,1,3.0529335

369,14,108,9,69,Yeah. Do you think the airport handled this appropriately? Diverting almost all flights and stranding those inside the terminal for hours?,69,69,60,1.0,1,1.5,,1.882361,2,1.7838781
370,14,108,10,60,"It's a tough decision. I don't think they handled it correctly, frankly.  But I'm also not surprised.  When something bad happens at an airport they usually shut things down.

371,14,108,11,69,I think its better to be safe then sorry. I suppose they probably thought the gunman was running around the airport at first before they found him in the truck. I just wonder why it took so long. ,69,69,60,2.0,2,1.0,,2.1845794,1,2.4046998
372,14,108,12,60,"Yeah, I'm not sure.  I know I'd be furious if I were in that situation and my flight was canceled.  To a large degree I think we punish the masses for the sake of the few far too often in this society.  But that's another issue.",60,69,60,2.0,2,1.0,,2.6149426,2,2.2003908
373,14,108,13,69,"I would be too, especially if it was an important trip. I'd also agree with your point. I wonder why the police also received reports of a second victim. That probably contributed to things being shut down. ",69,69,60,2.0,2,1.0,,2.2115116,1,2.4637413
374,14,108,14,60,"Yes, for sure.  I'm sure when things like this happen there are rumors flying all over the place.  People get information wrong, pass on information incorrectly, imagine things.  People aren't good witnesses.  So I'm sure in an instance like this--in all that chaos--there's all sorts of incorrect information or speculation and that uncertainty is one of the reasons why the whole airport can get shut down.",60,69,60,2.0,2,1.5,,2.4835343,2,1.8825037
375,14,108,15,69,"Yeah I suppose when there are lots of people in one place like this, when things go down it would be a bit crazy. Information may come in, but it has to be verified by looking at the footage, searching the airport, etc. Do you think anything could have been done to prevent the attack, or was it just something no one could have anticipated?",69,69,60,2.0,1,2.0,,2.335846,2,1.8908124
376,14,108,16,60,"It's hard to say without more evidence of what actually motivated it.  I think the reality is that if one deranged person wants to kill you, there's not a lot you can do to stop it.

377,14,108,17,69,"Yeah, once again I wish there was some more information here. I would have really liked to know what happened between the two. I also want to know if the gunman previously had issues or anything. I also wonder if Michael knew the gunman was after him. I'd agree, we can't put so much security and limitations in place that it impacts our lives to a major degree. It would be a pain to live that way.",69,69,60,2.0,2,3.0,,2.5749216,2,2.0493472
378,14,108,18,60,"Yes, it's a curious story.  I'd say that by definition the killer had issues to do this.  But again, it's totally unclear what precipitated this.",60,69,60,2.0,1,1.0,,1.6612649,1,1.5628138
379,14,108,19,69,I do wonder if the gunman used to work with the victim. Without some serious stalking I'd say that's the only way he knew their schedule/routine.,69,69,60,1.0,2,2.0,,2.242535,1,2.3728592
380,14,108,20,60,"Yes, that's certainly possible.  It's amazing to think a workplace conflict could lead to murder, but something did.  I thought it was conspicous that no details were given about the identity of the killer.  That usually means they're black.",60,69,60,2.0,2,2.0,,2.6179397,2,2.1077037
381,14,108,21,69,"I've certainly worked with some people that were a little off. I've always tried to avoid any conflict with people like that. The media/police do tend to hide identity when its someone who isn't white, I wish that trend would stop. People of all kind commit crime.",69,69,60,2.0,2,3.0,,2.6737866,2,2.2121606
382,14,108,22,60,"Yes, the media is just propaganda now.  It's hardly worth paying attention to.  There's lots more to be said about media in gernal but it's not really germane to this story.  If you were one of the victim's family members, would you rather not know the motivation for your father's killing?  Or would you rather find out it was something bad, like he was having a homosexual affiar or something disgusting?",60,69,60,2.0,2,2.0,,2.597444,2,2.1666107

384,14,108,24,60,"Yes, I think I agree with that.  Either way it's very sad for his family.  I wonder how the family of the murderer feels.  They must have mixed, strange emotions.",60,69,60,3.0,2,4.0,,2.3859727,2,2.8807564
385,14,108,25,69,"If I was the family of the murdered I would feel really ashamed, unless somehow they felt going after Michael was warranted somehow. I guess it all depends, without the information its hard to make a full judgement.",69,69,60,3.0,2,3.0,,2.5225704,2,2.3430786
386,14,108,26,60,"Yeah, I wouldn't be happen with what he did.  But he's also dead.  They also lost a loved one.  That's why I say it would be mixed emotions.",60,69,60,2.0,2,3.0,,2.3849807,2,2.6983185

395,14,109,5,67,I feel the same way. I also feel saddened by the event. An attack on another human being shouldn't have happened in the first place,67,67,102,3.0,2,3.5,,2.891212,2,2.754172

461,14,113,11,107,exactly.  Makes me wonder what happened that was so bad that drove him to do that.  I will never understand why if a person gets mad their first reaction is to shoot the other person,107,107,93,3.0,2,2.0,,2.6260455,2,2.382605
462,14,113,12,93,"That's what I fixated on as well, I hate to admit it, but a large part of me was wondering if he deserved it in some way, not that anyone ""deserves"" to be murdered.",93,107,93,2.0,2,2.0,,2.6540074,1,2.2797987

549,16,144,9,61,from my understanding there were rebels that were given an ultimatum to lay down their arms and if not they were going to be killed it also said the article was from CNN so I don't take too much stock and anything that comes from there ,61,61,111,2.0,2,3.0,,2.5911968,2,2.980677

583,16,145,13,112,"Probably to keep others from panicking. The article mentions the lack of aid and supplies in Aleppo. Do you think more can be done to help the civilians affected by the conflict? If so, what do you think should be done?",112,112,113,2.0,1,2.0,,2.1023796,1,2.7863157
584,16,145,14,113,"Yes, the Turkish government and other entities such as the USA proxy armies should stop attacking Syria",113,112,113,3.0,2,2.0,,1.6042784,1,1.978365
585,16,145,15,112,I agree. The USA seems to have their nose in everyone's business.,112,112,113,2.0,2,2.0,,2.512605,2,2.0153487
586,16,145,16,113,USA has a global war machine,113,112,113,3.0,2,1.0,,1.8008153,2,1.1432514
587,16,145,17,112,What do you think needs to happen for the conflict in Aleppo to come to an end and for the people there to begin to rebuild their lives?,112,112,113,2.0,1,2.0,,1.849818,1,1.9166625
588,16,145,18,113,it would be good for Turkey and USA and others to stop funding the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and other entities that are attacking the innocent Syrian people,113,112,113,2.0,2,3.0,,2.0402415,1,2.0829988
589,16,145,19,112,I think so as well. Now when do we get this code. It has been more than 15 respones,112,112,113,2.0,1,1.0,,1.150949,0,1.3317604
590,16,145,20,113,"we have to do 15 responses each, i think it is interesting that countries have these battles with each other but they all have a treaty together for Antarctica",113,112,113,2.0,1,1.0,,1.8856152,1,1.5432703
591,16,145,21,112,"Yes, Antarctica seems to have a lot of attention from people and yet we still don't know all about it. ",112,112,113,2.0,1,1.0,,1.4454598,2,1.5303161
592,16,145,22,113,i recently read about the Flat Earth Theory saying that Antarctica is an ice wall ,113,112,113,2.0,1,1.0,,0.59921384,1,0.8579212
593,16,145,23,112,I'll have to read into that. The article mentions that the Syrian government is accusing rebels of using civilians as human shields. What do you think about this accusation? Do you think it is a valid argument or an excuse to justify attacks on civilian areas?,112,112,113,2.0,1,1.0,,2.4295616,1,2.490025
594,16,145,24,113,"it is probably an excuse to justify attacks on civilian areas, i think Syria is telling the truth and the opposition is lying",113,112,113,2.0,2,2.0,,2.2178607,2,1.9989948
595,16,145,25,112,It also mentioned that the UN warned that eastern Aleppo was on the brink of starvation. Do you think that the international community has a responsibility to intervene in situations like this to prevent mass suffering?,112,112,113,2.0,1,2.0,,1.7895538,1,2.038863
596,16,145,26,113,"the ""international community"" seems to want to starve Syria perhaps because Syria is not willing to use the same monetary system as other countries?",113,112,113,3.0,1,1.0,,2.1599836,2,2.1645882
597,16,145,27,112,That is an interesting way to think about it. ,112,112,113,1.0,1,1.0,,1.6376034,1,1.663751
598,16,145,28,113,the United Nations and other entities want globalism with a one-world currency and one-world religion for maximum control,113,112,113,3.0,2,2.0,,2.1038415,1,1.3157994
599,16,145,29,112,So true. Sorry i'm running out of questions to ask,112,112,113,2.0,1,1.0,,1.6773851,1,1.3722823

603,16,150,3,119,Honestly I found the article overall sad especially with them having to abandon the area in 24 hours,119,119,72,3.0,2,3.0,,3.1059828,2,3.126427
604,16,150,4,72,So did I. Very tragic,72,119,72,3.0,2,3.0,,3.3122995,2,3.2663515
605,16,150,5,119,If only something could be done,119,119,72,2.0,2,4.0,,2.0575085,1,1.6486524
606,16,150,6,72,I think the article was quite dated though,72,119,72,1.0,1,2.0,,1.690388,2,1.5482843
607,16,150,7,119,Really? I was reading though the entire article and I was so focused that I could not find the date,119,119,72,2.0,1,3.0,,2.318008,2,1.5383613
608,16,150,8,72,"I seem to recall this happened a while back. Nevertheless, very sad to read",72,119,72,2.0,2,3.0,,3.2325547,2,2.8857443

610,16,150,10,72,"Yes, it's hard to imagine going through that",72,119,72,2.0,2,4.0,,3.0681293,2,3.2745802
611,16,150,11,119,A lot of people hopefully never have to go though an experience like that,119,119,72,2.0,1,4.0,,2.7644095,2,2.8705616
612,16,150,12,72,It shows the risks of a fragmented society,72,119,72,2.0,2,3.0,,2.1020048,2,1.9696374
613,16,150,13,119,Definitely but then you stop and think. Why is Russia getting involved in this Syrian Civil war? ,119,119,72,3.0,1,2.0,,1.6752679,1,1.4467053
614,16,150,14,72,And why is Turkey?,72,119,72,2.0,1,2.0,,0.6142279,1,0.6726421
615,16,150,15,119,"Exactly, what does Turkey have to do with this as well",119,119,72,3.0,1,2.0,,1.2197659,1,1.5906156
616,16,150,16,72,Great power rivalry I suppose,72,119,72,2.0,1,2.0,,1.9729437,2,1.45263
617,16,150,17,119,"I suppose so, but overall nothing we can do as much we would like to",119,119,72,2.0,2,3.0,,1.8961676,1,1.860728
618,16,150,18,72,"I agree, I wish we could",72,119,72,2.0,1,4.0,,2.0244503,1,2.156388
619,16,150,19,119,It further shows you the tragedy of war and why people should not be rooting for it,119,119,72,3.0,2,4.0,,2.5134528,2,2.4040892
620,16,150,20,72,What can we do though?,72,119,72,2.0,1,3.0,,1.7467222,1,1.3574489
621,16,150,21,119,Probably tell our US government that first of all war should never be celebrated,119,119,72,3.0,1,3.0,,2.7042756,0,1.9017065
622,16,150,22,72,DO they listen?,72,119,72,3.0,2,3.0,,1.302436,1,2.1091237
623,16,150,23,119,"Of course not, see what they are doing with Ukraine. There is no peace yet, and it just enriches the biggest weapon manufacturers.",119,119,72,3.0,2,3.0,,1.8978219,1,1.0803088
624,16,150,24,72,I agree,72,119,72,1.0,1,2.0,,1.38499,1,1.5145938
625,16,150,25,119,"Even though I see the war between Russia and Ukraine, as something Russia started. Sending more weapons definitely should be off the table",119,119,72,3.0,1,2.0,,1.8281689,1,0.9301434
626,16,150,26,72,It's important to vote,72,119,72,2.0,1,2.0,,2.3050575,1,1.4216127
627,16,150,27,119,"It's, not like either party cares honestly",119,119,72,2.0,1,2.0,,1.9424045,2,1.1403164

630,16,150,30,72,I hope it does soon,72,119,72,2.0,1,4.0,,2.444809,0,1.9488888
631,17,163,1,130,Hello,130,130,131,1.0,1,0.0,,1.0778334,1,0.7789489
632,17,163,2,131,Hi,131,130,131,1.0,1,0.0,,0.810271,1,0.88762105
633,17,163,3,130,So what did you think about the article?,130,130,131,1.0,1,0.0,,1.2977424,1,1.1430187
634,17,163,4,131,I thought it was rather depressing but honest. How about you?,131,130,131,2.0,2,3.0,,2.2439802,2,1.9671719
635,17,163,5,130,Same. It's horrible what those people are going through. I wish something could be done.,130,130,131,3.0,2,4.0,,4.071607,2,3.6907148
636,17,163,6,131,I feely you...when I read things like that I feel so helpless,131,130,131,2.0,2,4.0,,3.2508843,2,2.045797
637,17,163,7,130,"Yeah, no amount of human suffering is worth a war.",130,130,131,2.0,2,4.0,,2.4723458,2,2.6482017
638,17,163,8,131,"It all seems so futile, especially since the average family is the one who suffers the most, not the actual fighters.",131,130,131,2.0,2,4.0,,2.5961466,2,2.6358442
639,17,163,9,130,"Yep, the citizens are the ones who are displaced and end up starving to death.",130,130,131,2.0,2,4.0,,2.7173386,2,2.9537642
640,17,163,10,131,I can't help but think what would happen to my grandmother and family if there was a war like this in the US,131,130,131,2.0,2,3.0,,1.9595348,2,2.3194268
641,17,163,11,130,I think about the same thing. It's one of the reasons I fear a global conflict.,130,130,131,2.0,2,3.0,,1.8041735,1,1.549347
642,17,163,12,131,It could just as easily happen anywhere. It is scary and again makes me feel helpless.,131,130,131,2.0,2,3.0,,3.6049366,2,3.238904
643,17,163,13,130,Yep. I just wish all sides would just calm down and work things out diplomatically.,130,130,131,2.0,2,3.0,,2.7120118,2,2.7903476
644,17,163,14,131,Yeah but the Good Ole Boys Club will never let that happen.,131,130,131,3.0,2,2.0,,2.0427704,2,2.0344152
645,17,163,15,130,"Nope, there is just too much money to be made from weapons and defense contracts.",130,130,131,2.0,2,2.0,,2.365537,2,1.5635662
646,17,163,16,131,Exactly. The people at the root don't have to deal with the problems mentioned in the article,131,130,131,1.0,2,3.0,,1.7234493,2,1.7423154
647,17,163,17,130,"No, they don't deal with the problem, but sadly they're usually the ones creating it.",130,130,131,2.0,2,3.0,,1.9600116,2,2.0341601
648,17,163,18,131,Yes that's exactly what I mean. They make decisions that create major trickle down life and death scenarios constantly,131,130,131,2.0,2,3.0,,2.3516726,2,1.9976063
649,17,163,19,130,"People need to start voting for better leaders. Assuming they're a democracy, anyway.",130,130,131,2.0,0,3.0,,2.2203064,2,1.6189766

651,17,163,21,130,Yep. I wish more places would embrace the democratic process -- then a lot of this could be prevented.,130,130,131,2.0,0,2.0,,2.3405852,1,2.4103498
652,17,163,22,131,Yes but even democratic countries go to war and are capable of causing this kind of suffering,131,130,131,2.0,2,3.0,,2.715394,2,2.791102
653,17,163,23,130,"Yeah, I guess democracy doesn't do a lot of good if the country is filled with warmongering voters.",130,130,131,2.0,2,3.0,,2.1801016,2,1.6043377
654,17,163,24,131,Well said. I thought the point about the hospitals not being able to handle the chronic health issues of the elderly was an interesting and sad point as well,131,130,131,2.0,2,4.0,,2.0393558,1,2.1276014
655,17,163,25,130,"Yeah, they are too busy tending to battlefield wounds. It's sad. The man who lives with his ten children and grandchildren really stuck with me. I can't imagine living in fear of an airstrike on your house at any given moment.",130,130,131,3.0,2,4.0,,3.2345414,2,3.5456462
656,17,163,26,131,Right? It would be so exhausting and frustrating to live like that.,131,130,131,2.0,2,4.0,,3.3464956,2,3.2247267
657,17,163,27,130,It makes me grateful for what I have and where I live.,130,130,131,2.0,0,2.0,,2.4599702,0,1.9757979
658,17,163,28,131,No kidding. I don't think I'd be able to handle that kind of life.,131,130,131,3.0,0,3.0,,3.3941748,2,3.5341408
659,17,163,29,130,Nope. Those people are a lot stronger than I am.,130,130,131,2.0,1,3.0,,2.5766082,2,2.616237

665,17,164,5,132,I agree. There are so many wars going on around the world. I also wonder how I can help.,132,132,113,3.0,0,3.0,,2.2225685,1,2.2086978
666,17,164,6,113,The USA likes waging many wars,113,132,113,2.0,2,2.0,,2.017944,2,2.1531198

671,17,164,11,132,That makes sense. Have you ever experienced war first hand?,132,132,113,1.0,1,2.0,,1.6630425,1,1.7684013

692,17,170,2,136,Hi there!,136,135,136,1.0,1,1.0,,1.4831291,1,1.4599252
693,17,170,3,135,"Hi! So, how did you feel about the article?",135,135,136,1.0,1,1.0,,1.2585921,1,1.0931801
694,17,170,4,136,It left me a bit depressed and sad. How about you?,136,135,136,2.0,2,3.0,,2.5551386,2,2.3528125
695,17,170,5,135,Me too... I can't imagine what it'd be like to have to spend the final years of your life in a country with so much war.,135,135,136,3.0,2,3.0,,3.4836664,2,2.43862

699,17,170,9,135,Agreed. I don't think I could ever rest easily knowing that my parents lives are at risk like that.,135,135,136,2.0,2,3.0,,3.1524901,2,3.2648766
700,17,170,10,136,I guess the article also made me angry at how civilians get caught up in armed conflicts and are used by both/all sides.,136,135,136,3.0,2,4.0,,2.4530697,2,2.5356174
701,17,170,11,135,"I can agree with that. In war, it seems like civilians are seen simply as numbers, rather than human beings living real lives.

703,17,170,13,135,I wonder if there's another way. Does one really have to kill innocent people in order to make a point?,135,135,136,2.0,1,3.0,,2.8937864,2,2.6557589

707,17,170,17,135,"Huh, I never thought about it like that. I suppose so. Wouldn't they have children of their own at that point?",135,135,136,2.0,1,2.0,,2.158805,2,2.315501

713,17,170,23,135,"Lol, I would imagine that my parents would be the same, yes. Then again, it sounds like you're speaking about a situation in which families are nearly forced to live together, since there's no retirement or anything.

719,17,170,29,135,"Yeah... It seems that way. I wish I could show these people a better life somehow. It's so sad that people are forced to live their only life in the midst of a warzone. I know it's improbable, but I still wish I could.",135,135,136,2.0,2,4.0,,2.5100644,2,2.3964689

721,18,171,1,137,Whatd you think of the article?,137,137,60,1.0,1,0.0,,1.1465037,1,0.8950466
722,18,171,2,60,I thought it was interesting but I was curious to know how the polar bears' populations have changed during the time discussed.,60,137,60,2.0,1,2.0,,1.1430144,1,1.892216
723,18,171,3,137,"I agree, there wasn't much information given in that area",137,137,60,1.0,1,2.0,,1.9199198,2,2.0116873
724,18,171,4,60,I'm also curious to see how polar bears adapt to their changing conditions.  Life doesn't usually just roll over and die.  It adapts and finds a way.  I'm curious how their behavior is changing.,60,137,60,2.0,0,2.0,,1.9956253,1,2.1993027
725,18,171,5,137,It is tough without the population data because they could be handling very well,137,137,60,2.0,1,1.0,,1.179647,1,1.4128913
726,18,171,6,60,"Yes, I suppose.  I'm not sure that's likely, but it's possible. They're big, impressive creatures.  But even they're weak compared to nature.",60,137,60,2.0,2,2.0,,1.7311414,1,2.505958

730,18,171,10,60,"Yes, it's a very difficult problem to solve.  Does the thought of polar bears dying out make you sad, or does it make you happy because it means fewer seals are being eaten by polar bears?",60,137,60,1.0,2,2.0,,2.7194233,2,2.5852864
731,18,171,11,137,Definitely sad since that means that others can't experience also,137,137,60,3.0,2,3.0,,3.2002187,2,3.2035666
732,18,171,12,60,Polar bears are a unique and impressive species.  Have you ever seen one in person?  I've seen them at the Denver Zoo.,60,137,60,3.0,0,3.0,,2.0674148,1,2.5847309
733,18,171,13,137,Yeah I've seen one at the Cincinnati Zoo. Couldn't imagine not having polar bears around,137,137,60,1.0,0,3.0,,1.9460473,2,2.5405056
734,18,171,14,60,Do you think they'll adapt to their changing conditions?,60,137,60,1.0,1,2.0,,1.4274579,1,1.3886571
735,18,171,15,137,If the season is just shifting yes. Whats your viewpoint,137,137,60,1.0,0,2.0,,1.5984346,1,1.45645
736,18,171,16,60,"I think their behavior will definitely change.  If the ice patterns, which dictate their hunting behavior, change, they will migrate or do something to just to adapt.  That might involve infringing on human territory more often.  And at that point who knows what happens to them.  Because while polar bears are impressive, humans won't put up with them invading their spaces for too long.",60,137,60,3.0,0,3.0,,1.6035376,1,1.936111

738,18,171,18,60,"It's way too complex a problem to suggest one simple solution.  I personally think that concerns for the polar bears should come way, way down on a list of priorities.  What do you think?",60,137,60,2.0,1,1.0,,1.6890227,1,1.8309519
739,18,171,19,137,Im not sure. Do you think this seasonal shift could snowball into a large problem?,137,137,60,2.0,1,2.0,,1.6701597,1,1.4296318
740,18,171,20,60,"A large problem for whom?  I think this could certainly spell trouble for polar bears.  And that will have some effect on seal populations, and possibly human settlements in and around the arctic.

742,18,171,22,60,"Sure, that's possible.  Lots of things are possible.  I think in the short term, however, the polar bear populations will likely be decreasing, and something about the situation will have to change for the populations to start increasing.",60,137,60,2.0,2,2.0,,2.0150723,2,2.5141904
743,18,171,23,137,The shift is strange though. What were your first thoughts on the article,137,137,60,1.0,1,2.0,,1.5074519,1,1.485369
744,18,171,24,60,"I just found it interesting and I was curious about learning more about the effects the seasonal shifts are having.  Are more male polar bears eating more baby polar bears, for example, to make up for more difficult hunting conditions?  Because I believe male polar bears will cannibalize other bears.",60,137,60,2.0,2,1.0,,1.9144175,1,1.981878
745,18,171,25,137,Its definitely possible. I think that they could just be eating less also.,137,137,60,1.0,1,3.0,,2.4782348,2,2.8561213
746,18,171,26,60,"Yes, that's possible.  And I wonder how that changes their behavior, too.  For example, are they hibernating for shorter periods of time?  And how does all this affect pregnancies?  Lots of interesting questions.  It's like a labratory for studying how life adapts and changes in the face of changing environmental conditions.",60,137,60,1.0,1,2.0,,1.429813,1,2.2538083

775,18,172,25,73,"I think that people should make the changes they feel they can make. If all they want to do is recycle, then that's it.  I believe it's really the small changes that will make a difference, if everyone does at least one small change.",73,73,138,2.0,0,3.5,,2.0630357,1,1.9104218

782,18,173,2,61,Hello. Yes I did. What were the emotions that you took from it and what was your first reaction regarding it?,61,107,61,1.0,1,3.0,,2.1951075,1,1.4443185
783,18,173,3,107,"It was heartbreaking to hear that they are loosing the ability to survive. my first reaction was, If people need proof that global warming is happing, then read this article",107,107,61,3.0,2,3.0,,2.8486807,2,2.8234751
784,18,173,4,61," That's what I was going to ask you, what you thought the article was more geared towards. I couldn't tell if it was kind of both or was referring mostly to climate change or the polar bears",61,107,61,2.0,2,4.0,,1.4635019,1,1.688285
785,18,173,5,107,"Thats what i took from it, was about how global warming is causing the polar bears across the artic to have shorter winters etc. with them loosing about 7 weeks each year or so for the past 35 years. its about a 25% loss over the 35 years of study they done",107,107,61,2.0,2,3.0,,1.5779631,1,1.3546746
786,18,173,6,61,yeah 25% as a whole bunch in my opinion. That would mean in 140 years or less but it'll be gone? Am I doing the math correctly?,61,107,61,2.5,2,3.0,,2.2646513,2,1.6539004
787,18,173,7,107,I think that sounds about right. Wither the data presented was inflated or not. hard to say. There is defiantly a loss there for sure. ,107,107,61,2.0,2,3.0,,1.9166136,2,1.7892447
788,18,173,8,61,that is tragic very sad where are the polar bears going to go if that happens?,61,107,61,2.5,2,3.0,,2.6956615,2,3.6278136
789,18,173,9,107,"thats what I was thinking. I know they are on the endangered species list.  Sad reality is, people are too selfish. so more then likely they will all die out. besides the ones in captivity and the ones who live in Alaska etc. ",107,107,61,2.5,2,3.0,,2.7487316,2,2.983048
790,18,173,10,61," Yes I was wondering if they were still on the endangered species list as well. I need to brush up on my geography that's for sure because I don't even know what is near there. I would have to Google it, it's been a long time ",61,107,61,1.5,2,3.0,,1.9047909,1,2.0403569
791,18,173,11,107,I think what they were referring to was Antarctica. I think there are some small towns and such there. Inuit's mostly probably (guessing)  but as far as countries and what not. i think Africa is close?  Same for me. i need to brush up on locations etc. i know the general area lol.,107,107,61,2.0,1,3.0,,1.590635,1,2.2978873
792,18,173,12,61,Same here lol I know the area but it's been so long since I was in school but I guess I should be more aware of things like this. But surely since the study was done that they can come up with a plan or are working on one to help the polar bears there's something awful like that does happen or continues to happen I should say,61,107,61,2.0,2,3.0,,2.2637937,2,2.374411
793,18,173,13,107,yeah totally. More then likely they just want to leave them alone and just store data. but as it dwindles down to the last few they will start protecting them in reserves and such im guessing as well lol,107,107,61,2.0,2,3.0,,1.9276524,1,1.9948418
794,18,173,14,61,I hope they wouldn't let them like starve to death or watch them die or something.. somebody's gotta do something about that.,61,107,61,2.5,2,3.0,,3.0437849,2,2.754638
795,18,173,15,107,maybe they will start air dropping food in or something in remote locations where the tribes of the polar bears are. Might just scare them away though,107,107,61,1.5,2,3.0,,1.9622322,1,2.7370663
796,18,173,16,61,Hey that's a really good idea airdropping food! Holy smokes that's like really incredible idea good  thinking!! I see your point too I doubt it might scare them away but hopefully it wouldn't because they would be hungry enough they would go to the food ,61,107,61,3.0,0,3.0,,2.2398732,1,2.6633577
797,18,173,17,107,"another downside i was thinking was if they did air drop food in, im wondering if they would just become reliant on that and tend to stay in the area where it was dropped expecting more to come etc. Thus causing them to not hunt at all. (could be a longshot of a thought) lol ",107,107,61,3.0,2,3.0,,1.9506025,1,2.0242717
798,18,173,18,61,"(i typed ""I see your point too about it might scare away"" my auto correct changed my word to the word ""doubt"" lol sorry) that's a another great point that you bring up about them becoming reliant and staying in the area. Hopefully the researchers come up with something innovative if they can come up with AI which is absolutely incredible in my opinion they should surely be able to come up with something to help this circumstance. ",61,107,61,2.0,0,4.0,,2.1220784,1,1.744997
799,18,173,19,107,"Yeah i agree.  With their 35 years of data they have, they should be able to think of something. lol..... On a side note. i think we still have a few more rounds of this to go before we submit lol",107,107,61,2.0,0,4.0,,2.1099896,1,1.6546829
800,18,173,20,61,lol yes im at 9 right now i think... So if you were in charge of a research team and in the Arctic  dealing with this what would be the first thing that you do? ,61,107,61,2.0,1,4.0,,1.3322688,1,0.8349699
801,18,173,21,107,I think its 30 total for both of us combined. which means 9 more after this message if thats the case.  If i were in charge? Hard to say without knowing all of the other data that they have found. We were only presented with a small amount for purposes of the article. I would say try to observe first then interact where you can. Overall you want them to still be in their own environment and such,107,107,61,2.0,1,3.0,,1.6749979,1,1.9623711
802,18,173,22,61,yes its 30 combined 15 each... Yes we were presented with a small amount of info from the article I probably asked a crazy question lol I was just brainstorming on the idea you had because I thought it was really good about dropping in the food that was really good ,61,107,61,2.0,0,3.0,,2.5218363,1,2.7451615
803,18,173,23,107,"yeah i think that might be the best. dropping some sort of food via air drop. wither it be live game they can ""hunt"" still themselves. or some sort of food already cut up for them. some way that can still give them a sense of they are doing it on their own lol",107,107,61,2.0,0,3.0,,2.1823058,1,2.3708823
804,18,173,24,61,Live game that's pretty good right there too. That way they don't become human dependent and don't forget to learn how to hunt ,61,107,61,2.0,0,3.0,,2.2818742,1,2.0087376
805,18,173,25,107,"thats kind of the route that i think might be best or more ""natural"" i guess",107,107,61,1.0,0,3.0,,1.5345783,1,1.4819102
806,18,173,26,61,yes I agree. What is that called when animals that are wild become dependent on humans it's not like being team but there's another name for it and I cannot think of what it's called it's right on the tip of my tongue ,61,107,61,2.0,1,3.0,,2.5516865,2,1.8674185
807,18,173,27,107,i think i know what your talking about. lol now i cant think of the name either ,107,107,61,2.0,1,4.0,,1.6124612,1,1.0473025
808,18,173,28,61,lol that's gonna drive me crazy til i remember lol. It'll be one of those things that come to me at 3 o'clock in the morning when I'm not thinking about it lol ,61,107,61,3.0,0,3.0,,2.5437593,1,1.9429007
809,18,173,29,107,haha i know that feeling. might be something i have to end up googling. lol,107,107,61,2.0,0,3.0,,2.414583,2,1.3885615

813,18,174,3,122,Were you aware of what was happening to the polar bear population prior to reading this?,122,122,139,1.0,1,1.0,,1.5756015,1,1.9902098
814,18,174,4,139,"I had known that ice was melting in the polar regions, but I hadn't really thought about how much it might impact polar bears and other animals. What about you?",139,122,139,1.0,1,2.0,,1.5693365,1,0.9203117
815,18,174,5,122,"Same, I guess I hadn't focused too much on the polar bear population. It's sad to think this is happening.",122,122,139,2.0,2,3.0,,2.525151,2,2.7413082
816,18,174,6,139,"Yeah, it is not fun to think that we might be causing issues for the polar bears. It was a bit of an eye opener to make me think about it like that.",139,122,139,2.0,2,3.0,,2.5033045,2,2.656878
817,18,174,7,122,Do you believe climate change is occurring and caused by humans?,122,122,139,1.0,1,2.0,,1.0786111,1,0.73174965
818,18,174,8,139,"Yeah, I definitely believe that climate change is happening and is primarily caused by humans. I think it's awful how much we are abusing the planet. That's just my feelings on it though.",139,122,139,3.0,2,4.0,,2.6192026,2,2.3075135

821,18,174,11,122,What are some of the way you are trying to lessen your impact on global warming?,122,122,139,1.0,1,2.0,,1.4343827,1,0.9254171
822,18,174,12,139,"I try to minimize the electricity I use. I'll turn lights off when I'm not using them, I keep my home cool in winter, warmer in summer. Things like that.",139,122,139,2.0,1,2.0,,2.2003894,1,2.4379578
823,18,174,13,122,I do those things as well. I recently bought a hybrid vehicle as I am not quite sold on full electric yet but I feel good about that.,122,122,139,2.0,0,2.0,,2.3328128,0,1.9151454
824,18,174,14,139,Nice! That's definitely a good and large step to take. Hybrids definitely are better for the environment than non-hybrids. The polar bears would thank you :),139,122,139,3.0,0,3.0,,1.9509742,0,1.0890319

827,18,174,17,122,My electric bills were astronomical this last winter. I hope to offset a lot of that through solar. ,122,122,139,2.0,0,1.0,,1.9350607,1,1.6820776
828,18,174,18,139,Smart thinking. Also I should have asked earlier to make sure we got the same article. Was yours about how ice was melting more and the data associated with the research? ,139,122,139,2.0,1,1.0,,1.2679647,1,0.9060439
829,18,174,19,122,"Yes, that is corect, same article",122,122,139,1.0,1,1.0,,1.6811715,1,1.6082301

831,18,174,21,122,"I agree, that was surprising. Do you think we will be able to stop or reverse global warming?",122,122,139,2.0,1,2.0,,2.1753159,2,1.987895
832,18,174,22,139,"I sure hope so, but I'm not sure. It seems like it might already be too late, but scientific advances are always surprising me. Also as it gets harder and harder to deny it, more money will get invested in research.",139,122,139,2.0,1,2.0,,2.4515789,1,2.6654544
833,18,174,23,122,I hope so as well. I get a bit nervous for my kids and society's future when I think about the lasting impacts.,122,122,139,3.0,2,2.0,,2.3306892,1,2.577127
834,18,174,24,139,Hopefully the future will be better for your kids! Using those polar bears and other cute animals might be a good way to get people to pay more attention. It's hard to say no to cute animals.,139,122,139,3.0,0,3.0,,2.49784,1,2.5491457
835,18,174,25,122,"Great point, I hope that is a selling point for others! I just can't understand why some people chose to disregard the issue. Unfortunately the government may need to impost stricter guidelines for people like that.",122,122,139,3.0,2,3.0,,2.494141,2,1.8821559
836,18,174,26,139,Gonna be hard to impose stricter guidelines since people who don't believe in it are generally against more government interference. Fingers crossed though they will change their mind.,139,122,139,2.0,1,3.0,,2.1078591,2,1.7327114

913,19,183,13,143,i wondered too. I didn't know that being adopted by us citizens didn't automatically make you a citizen,143,143,49,2.0,2,2.0,,2.0891263,1,2.4575856
914,19,183,14,49,that makes no sense,49,143,49,2.0,2,2.0,,1.7206355,1,1.6548839

950,19,184,20,145,The problem is that the changes we have made are designed to hurt people.

966,19,190,6,130,It's horrible. I feel like an exception should be made in his case. It wasn't his fault.,130,149,130,2.5,2,4.0,,2.5829055,2,2.2035131
967,19,190,7,149,There were obvious mistakes made during the adoption process when he was a child.  He should not be punished for those mistakes.,149,149,130,2.0,2,3.0,,3.2571416,2,2.9482112

969,19,190,9,149,I agree.   Deporting him rips his family apart and causes everyone to suffer.,149,149,130,2.0,2,3.0,,2.7863941,2,2.6830187
970,19,190,10,130,"And all for what was essentially a paperwork error. Given the life he lived up to that point with the abuse he suffered, it's hard to not feel sorry for him.",130,149,130,2.0,2,4.0,,2.427733,2,2.0012224
971,19,190,11,149,This case was a few years ago.  Do you know what eventually transpired?,149,149,130,1.5,1,0.0,,2.0839105,1,1.6880848
972,19,190,12,130,"Supposedly there was a bill that was being debated in Congress. I don't know if it passed, but I think it might've been too late for Crapser anyway. ",130,149,130,1.5,2,2.0,,1.9837394,1,2.279256
973,19,190,13,149,Yeah.  Looks that way.  I think that he was eventually deported.   Too bad the case didn't get more media attention at the time it was happening.,149,149,130,2.0,2,2.0,,2.5149987,2,2.25674

975,19,190,15,149,It's even worse because his kids are really young and at the age where they need a father presence in their lives.,149,149,130,2.5,2,3.0,,3.0837107,2,3.3043547

977,19,190,17,149,"I believe that there were a lot of ""hidden"" issues in the adoption system back in the 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s.   I don't think a lot of changes were made until issues were identified starting in the 1980s.",149,149,130,2.5,2,0.0,,2.3050709,2,2.25954
978,19,190,18,130,It's probably still broken. I hope no other family has to go through this. Just no excuse for it. Hopefully Crapser found a way to get back to his family.,130,149,130,2.0,2,3.0,,2.675825,1,2.615392

983,19,190,23,149,"Also, most of this transpired during the Obama administration.   The Trump administration became even more hardline on deportations.",149,149,130,1.5,1,1.0,,2.712537,2,2.5556178
